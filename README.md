# StarWeatherApplication

## What this is

- This is the front end of my "react-weatherapp". It is being separated from the ASP.NET api used to handle all backend request. This should help packing it with electron.js easier as there is not much documentation on how to package a single solution program with C# and react. 

- This will be the packaged version of electron

# Installation

- Clone the repo to your machine, run the `npm start` command and it will open locally on your machine. Keep in mind for this to do anything other than search the weather, you will need to download my StarWeatherAPI and configure it for your own use. 

# Usage
- Search the weather in the search bar.

- Login and all its associated features will not work until you download and configure the backend API

- Will be including the API repo link shortly
